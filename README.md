# Concordance

Implemented code to create concordance which is the alphabetical index of the principal words of a book or document with a reference to the passage in which it occurs for any input document given.
The finished result will be a file containing an alphabetical listing of all the words, and with each word the number of times it appeared in that document and a list of the line numbers on which the word was found.
